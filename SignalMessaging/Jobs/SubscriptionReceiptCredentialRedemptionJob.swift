/// Manages "donation receipt credential" redemption.
///
/// Donation payments are handled differently depending on the payment method.
/// Ultimately, however, all payments are "confirmed" – this means the user has
/// authorized the payment. Once that happens, we end up with a "payment intent
/// ID" as well as a "receipt credential request/context".
///
/// At this point, we're in a zero-knowledge world – neither the payment intent
/// ID nor the receipt credential request are associated with our account.
///
/// We take the payment intent ID and receipt credential request, and send them
/// (unauthenticated) to Signal servers. If the payment in question has been
/// "processed" (per the relevant payment processor, such as Stripe), the server
/// returns us a value that we can combine with our receipt credential request
/// context to create a zero-knowledge "receipt credential".
///
/// Note that if the payment has not processed successfully we instead receive
/// an error, which can tell us the status of the payment and how to proceed.
/// For example, the payment may have failed to process, or may still be pending
/// but not have affirmatively failed – we want to respond differently to those
/// scenarios.
///
/// *Finally*, we make an authenticated request to send a presentation for the
/// ZK receipt credential to the service – thereby proving that we have made a
/// donation – which assigns a badge to our account.
///
/// - Note
/// Some payment types (such as credit cards) usually process immediately, but
/// others (such as SEPA debit transfers) can take days/weeks to process.
///
/// - Note
/// The term "subscription" is overloaded. It can either refer to a donation,
/// either one-time or recurring, as in the context of this class name. It can
/// also refer to a recurring donation, as in "subscriber ID", which is only
/// relevant for recurring donations. Good luck.
